# fyelic-arduino

This collection of Arduino examples and wiring diagrams was created for the First Year Engineering Learning & Innovation Center (FYELIC) at Northeastern University.
Each sketch is named according to that single component used in the sketch. These examples are distinct from the SIK code guide (which is part of the current 
curriculum and from which these examples were based) because the SIK examples incorporate several components into a single sketch. To ease in the debugging process 
for us tutors at FYELIC and to help with students creating their own Arduino projects, these sketches use singular components.


Many of the components come from the 37 Sensor Kit V 2.0 by Elegoo. Check out https://www.elegoo.com/pages/arduino-kits-support-files and click the "ELEGOO 37 in 1 Sensor Modules Kit" for access to a multitude of resources from which these sketches and wire diagrams were used. It also includes full tutorials for each component beyond the sketches and diagrams provided here.
